Last update 2020/07/09

### WARNING/DISCLAIMER: We cannot recommend the use of this device on medical applications since it has not been extensively proven. In this project our focus is on reporting the current performance of the device and sharing knowledge that can be used for the development of alternative equipment that can be used in the context of COVID 19. At the current stage this device does not meet all all technical requirements, however we meet some technical requirements that are important. Any further development must be acompanied with the supervision of medical experts. There is a significan risk associated with the inapropiate use of any medical equipment and precautions must be followed. 


Acknowledgements: We thank the collaboration of many profesionals, specially those from the Hospital Clinico Universidad de Chile and also expert advice from professionals from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. Through the development of this project we have shared experience and knowledge about the funcioning of several components. 

### ADDITIONAL WARNINGS: This device has not been tested to meet any FDA regulation and has not been certified.

### MOTIVATION

High Flow Nasal Therapy is an alternative treatment for CODVID 19 patients. Implementing a HFNT device seems less complicated and less expensive than implementing a mechanical ventilator. Moreover it has been reported that HFNT produces less colateral damage to lungs and is also linked with better recovery. 


### TECNICAL REQUIREMENTS


R1. Adjustable Air Flow (Flujo regulable de aire).

The air flow should be in the range of 50 to 70 L/min. 

R2. Mixing Air and Oxygen (Mezcla de Aire y oxígeno en forma regulada).

It should be possible to mix air and oxygen and to regulate the flow of both. Different levels of FiO2 should be
attained. 

R3. Humidification (Humidificación)

Air reaching the patient must be humidified (RH 100%, AH 84 mg/L)

R4. Temperature (Temperatura)

Air must be pre-heated and should reach the patient at a temperature or 37 degrees C. 

R5. Use of heated tube (Uso de tubo calefaccionado)

A pre heated tube must be used to prevent condensation. 

R6. Nasal Cannula (Cánula nasal)

Include a nasal cannula. 

R7. Rapid fabrication.

Implemented ASAP.

R7. Scalability

Several units must be produced.
